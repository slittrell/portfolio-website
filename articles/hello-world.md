Welcome to my writing corner. I plan to use this space to share thoughts on software engineering, language learning, theology, and whatever else is on my mind.

## Why Write?

Writing forces clarity of thought. As an engineer, I spend most of my day solving problems in code. But some of the most valuable insights come from stepping back and articulating ideas in plain language.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Software engineering** -- lessons from building enterprise CRM software at Veeva Systems, and side projects in the iOS and web ecosystems.
- **Language and culture** -- reflections from studying Mandarin Chinese in China as an NSLI-Y scholar, and ongoing Korean studies.
- **Theology and ministry** -- thoughts from my M.Div. studies at Southern Seminary.
- **Miscellaneous** -- book reviews, interesting problems, and things I'm learning.

## Stay Tuned

This is just the beginning. If any of that sounds interesting, check back soon. Thanks for reading.
